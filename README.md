# Fetal Health Data Analysis
## Summary: 
This project involves an in-depth analysis of fetal health data using a dataset with 22 features and around 2000 rows. The goal is to identify patterns, trends, and insights related to fetal health and develop predictive models that can classify different fetal health states. This analysis can contribute to understanding fetal health risks and inform healthcare decisions.

## Dataset Overview:
The dataset used in this analysis includes 21 features related to fetal health parameters such as fetal_movement, uterine contractions, and accelerations. Each row represents a sample, with a target label indicating the fetal health state. This project focuses on:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution, correlations, and patterns.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering to optimize model performance.
- Use PCA for dimension reduction from 21 features to 2 or 3 principal components.
- Model training and evaluation for classifying fetal health states. Train 4 models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Neural Network

 ## Requirements:
 To run this project, you will need the following libraries:
 - Python 3.x
 - pandas
 - numpy
 - matplotlib
 - seaborn
 - scikit-learn
 - pytorch
